# Soulless GEGL <sub><sup>ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦</sup></sub>

A collection of GEGL GIMP plugins made by me. Right now there's only one (so not really a collection, but there will be more in the future).

## How to install

Download the pack here and paste them into your GEGL plugins folder:

Linux
```
~/.local/share/gegl-0.4/plug-ins/
```

Windows
```
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\gegl-0.4\plug-ins
```
